In the 14th century it was when the peasantry became more important with the creation of more rural houses that served as accommodation for the extensive family, minors, and pastors, all of whom were in charge of working the land to obtain products such as wine, flour, oil, cold meat, or esparto.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The crisis of the traditional world, and of the peasantry in particular, is a reality that has affected many Catalan regions for decades. In order to face the aforementioned crisis and reduce its effects, one of the challenges of the rural world is the diversification of its activities and attract new emerging sectors.');
define ('DESCRIPCION_IDENTIDAD_TURISMO_RURAL_2', 'Catalonia, one of the main tourist regions of Europe, has relatively late incorporated rural tourism. It was not until the nineties that rural tourism began to grow remarkably. Gradually, it has been positioning itself as a strategic sector for the interior and mountain regions; and at this point, the strong growth of rural houses in Catalonia shows that this tourist activity begins to become an alternative to leisure in sun and beach tourism and other more massive offers.
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Catalonia is one of the leading regions in rural tourism, and this is due to several factors. The combination between a territory full of contrasts and the great offer and professionalization that is had. In Catalonia you will always find what you are looking for, from the high mountain in the Pyrenees, through the intriguing inland villages, to the long coastline that goes from Cap de Creus to the Delta de l\'Ebre.');

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The farmhouses in Catalonia have a similar structure throughout the territory, with days of plants and loft. However, there are notable differences according to the area in which they are found, it is not the same as a country house in the Pyrenees than a country house in the Penedès. The ancestral homes, they are larger and previously totally self-sufficient, that is why they lived there up to three generations at the same time.');

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The Catalan rural houses can be found both in the middle of small villages and isolated areas of the natural environment.

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The interior of Catalonia has a great charm, full of small villages such as Sant Jaume de Frontanyà, (the smallest in Catalonia), and cities far from the massif and with a great tradition such as Berga with the famous Patum festival, the which has recently been declared a World Heritage Site, or Vic, with the Plaza Mayor and its famous sausages.');

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Perhaps the Costa Brava is the most well-known part of the entire Catalan coast, made up of small villages that formerly were fishing villages, with white houses and a great tradition for its streets.

// TEXTOS AL FINAL DE LAS LANDINGS DE PROVINCIAS

define ('LANDING_BARCELONA_FOOTER', '
<p>Normally, we relate <strong>Barcelona</strong> to the great cosmopolitan and dynamic city, where daily activities are combined with the constant visit of tourists to the main attractions and places of interest that the city offers. But in the province of <strong>Barcelona</strong> not only does it focus on the city, it also has a large territory to discover and with a large number of rural houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The area closest to <strong>Barcelona</strong> has different landscapes where you can make a relaxing stay, without the stress of the big city and in direct contact with nature. One of the areas closest to <strong>Barcelona</strong> is the <strong>Garraf</strong> <strong>Natural</strong> <strong>Park</strong>, a place where Mediterranean forests are combined with the <strong>Garraf</strong> coastline, reaching <strong>Sitges</strong>, the main city in the area, in which we emphasize the festival of cinema Fantastic that is made at the beginning of October.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Near <strong>Barcelona</strong>, if we go to the interior we find the mystic mountain of <strong>Montserrat</strong>, a paradise for climbers, and with a monastery famous for its students and the famous "virolai". If you go to <strong>Montserrat</strong> you have to try the monkey that is made in the mountains, one of the best cheeses in the country! In <strong>Montserrat</strong> you can reach it by foot, by car, coach or zipper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the area we also find the <strong>Natural Park of Sant Lloren&ccedil; de Munt and l\'Obac</strong>, where Mola stands out, a mountain suitable for all audiences and offers a great view from the restaurant on the top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we go to the interior of the province of <strong>Barcelona</strong> there are different counties such as <strong>Osona</strong> and <strong>El Bages</strong>, which have a great offer of <strong>rural houses in Catalonia</strong> of all kinds, in addition, there are many attractions to be visited should you stay there. The cities such as <strong>Manresa</strong> and <strong>Vic</strong>, are very traditional places full of history and charm in its streets, and you can also enjoy the typical food of the interior of <strong>Catalonia</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between the region of <strong>Osona</strong> and <strong>La Selva</strong> we also highlight the <strong>Montseny Natural Park</strong>, declared a Biosphere Reserve for UNESCO thanks to its ecological diversity and the particular area of the area, Tur&oacute; de l&rsquo;Home and El Matagalls are the Two taller peaks in the area, where several rivers and rivers that bring a lot of life also create. The villages of the area are also the most enchanting ones like <strong>Viladrau, Sant Miquel del Fai, or Espinelves</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the counties with a better offer of <strong>rural houses in Catalonia</strong> is <strong>Bergued&agrave;</strong>, a region located in the <strong>Pre-Pyrenees</strong>, in which is the <strong>Natural Park of Cad&iacute; and Moixer&oacute;</strong>, a mountainous area with rich flora and fauna, which turns out to be the paradise for mushroom lovers. From this area we can see the Pedraforca mountain, which can be seen from all the surrounding villages because it is alone. In Bergued&agrave; you can stay at any time of the year, as it has ski slopes and different natural pools. The capital of this region is Berga, which is known by Patum, a festival recently cataloged as an Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another obligatory place to visit for a rural tourism stay in the province of <strong>Barcelona</strong> is <strong>Pened&egrave;s</strong>, a land of wines and cavas, which means that in all the villages of the area there are small, familiar and cozy wineries to large multinational companies dedicated to the sector. Specialized routes, wine tasting and cavas, and excursions through the many paths that cross the vineyards can be made through the area. The main town in the area is <strong>Vilafranca del Pened&egrave;s</strong>, with a great culture of "castells".</p>
');
define ('LANDING_GIRONA_FOOTER', '
<p>Located in northeastern <strong>Catalonia</strong>, we find <strong>Girona</strong>, a magnificent city that has maintained the charm and heritage of the different cultures that have happened during the different periods of history. Ibers, Romans, Medieval, and Jews left their mark in <strong>Girona</strong> that today we can enjoy. But apart from a charming city, <strong>Girona</strong> is much more, in the whole province there are different landscapes and locations that make it one of the best regions for the practice of rural tourism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Costa Brava</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coastal part of <strong>Girona</strong> is what we call <strong>Costa Brava</strong>, one of the most visited regions of the country in summer, thanks to the large number of beaches typical of the Mediterranean Sea, with crystalline water and steep coastline. In this coastal region there are many municipalities that stand out for its charm and that formerly dedicated exclusively to fishing like <strong>Calella de Palafrugell</strong>, <strong>Palam&oacute;s</strong>, <strong>L\'Escala</strong>, <strong>Cadaqu&eacute;s</strong> ... Another of the charms of the Costa Brava is the influence that it had Salvador Dal&iacute; during his years of life, in <strong>Portlligat, P&uacute;bol, and especially in Figueres</strong>, you can visit the works of art and learn more about the life of one of the best surrealist artists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it is part of the coast, it also has a great heritage that can be visited at any time of the year. The round road that runs along the coast is one of the best options for hiking and being able to visit both the coast landscapes and the small villages of the area. <strong>Pals, Sant Pere Pescador, Els Aiguamolls de l\'Empord&agrave;</strong>, or the <strong>Monastery of Sant Pere de Rodes</strong> are some of the places of interest that are found in the inner part of the Costa Brava.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interior of Girona</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large part of the province of Girona is the interior, that is, the entire territory that we find between the <strong>Costa Brava</strong> and the <strong>Pyrenees</strong>. The city of <strong>Girona</strong>, small villages, forests, meadows, wineries ... are some of the attractions of the inner <strong>Girona</strong> that you can not miss if you make a rural tourism stay in the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main municipality in the area is <strong>Girona</strong>, a city full of culture and charm, with an old town full of services, restaurants and shops. In <strong>Girona</strong> we must also highlight the "El Celler de Can Roca" restaurant, which has been named several times as the best restaurant in the world, but if you want to go to lunch, you have to reserve a table one year in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from the city of <strong>Girona</strong>, in the interior of the province there are many other places of interest to visit or stay there. <strong>La Garrotxa</strong>, or the<strong> Estany de Banyoles</strong> (a lake) are two places to visit. In <strong>L\'Estany</strong>, you can do many outdoor activities, both aquatic and in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>La Garrotxa</strong> is one of the counties with the most rural houses in Catalonia. It is a traditional region that was originally dedicated almost exclusively to agriculture and livestock. <strong>The Volcanic Zone of La Garrotxa, La Fageda d\'en Jord&agrave;, the Vall d\'en Bas, or iconic villages such as Castellfollit de la Roca, Beget, or Besal&uacute;</strong>, are the main attractions of this Catalan region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pyrenees</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the northernmost part of <strong>Girona</strong>, we find the <strong>Pyrenees</strong>, the main mountain system in Catalonia, which is divided between the provinces of Lleida and Girona. The counties of <strong>Ripoll&egrave;s</strong> and <strong>La</strong> <strong>Cerdanya</strong> are the two that belong to the <strong>Pyrenees</strong> and <strong>Girona</strong>. In these counties, there are plenty of excursions to the mountains and valleys, and there are also villages with a certain charm such as <strong>Camprodon, Alp, Puigcerd&agrave;, Bellver de Cerdanya, or Queralbs and the Vall de N&uacute;ria</strong>. All these towns have a clear Romanesque style that identifies them and conforms to the Romanesque route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gastronomy</p>

<p>In the same way that <strong>Girona</strong> has a great diversity of territory it also has a very rich gastronomy. Each area has its typical products that are used to make the most traditional elaborations, in the part of the <strong>Costa Brava and the Empord&agrave;</strong>, with a clear marine influence, they are typical of fish and shellfish, such as the anchovies of l&rsquo;Escala or prawns of Palam&oacute;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more inland, the more plentiful are dishes, for example, in the case of Girona city, the "xuxo" is typical, a pastry with cream and sugar. In the part of <strong>La Garrotxa</strong> and the <strong>Pyrenees</strong>, the meat and vegetables take center stage and emphasize the dishes such as the trinxat de la <strong>Cerdanya</strong>, escudella, or sausages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without forgetting the delicious wines that are produced in the vineyards of the <strong>Empord&agrave;</strong>!</p>

<p>Lleida is the region that we find in the west of Catalonia, being the only one of the four provinces without sea, is the one that we relate to the interior of Catalonia and the one that offers a great variety of landscapes, from the <strong>gorge of Mont-rebei</strong>, passing through the <strong>plain of Lleida</strong>, to the <strong>Park of the High Pyrenees</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heritage</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting from the north, Lleida has a large part of the <strong>Catalan Pyrenees</strong>, this part is called the <strong>Pyrenees of Lleida</strong> and includes some of the most impressive <strong>Natural Parks in Catalonia</strong>, such as the <strong>Natural Park of the High Pyrenees</strong> and the <strong>Aig&uuml;estortes National Park</strong> and <strong>Lake of Sant Maurici</strong>. Two parks of high mountain ideal for lovers of hiking and mountaineering as we find high altitude peaks. These parks also stand out for the large number of lakes and ponds that they have, which bring a lot of life and create wonderful landscapes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the most southern part, in the <strong>Pre-Pyrenees</strong>, we come across the <strong>Natural Park of Cad&iacute; and Moixer&oacute;</strong>, a mountainous system of less altitude than the Pyrenees but with the same charm. It is an ideal place for mountain lovers, where you can do many activities, such as looking for mushrooms in autumn or enjoy the abundant wildlife of the area among which we highlight the time of the rutting of the deer in the months of September and October.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lleida</strong> is a territory where culture is very alive. In the highest part of the <strong>Pyrenees</strong>, we find many villages and churches with a clear Romanesque style very characteristic of the area and which has been classified as a <strong>World Heritage Site by UNESCO</strong>. Also in this high mountain area, many traditions that are very impressive in the eyes of a stranger are still alive. The one that stands out the most is the torch descent that is done around San Juan in the different mountain towns of the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adventure sports</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the wonderful natural environment that the province of Lleida has, it also has a wide range of activities to do outdoors with a wide range of levels so that they can be done with children, friends, or as a couple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these sports or activities to do outdoors are divided between winter and summer since a large part of the adventure tourism in the area is exclusive to do with snow. <strong>Baqueira-Beret</strong>, <strong>Bo&iacute; Ta&uuml;ll</strong>, <strong>Espot</strong>, and <strong>Port Ain&eacute;</strong> are the main ski resorts that can be found in Lleida where you can enjoy all kinds of activities related to snow, as well as the different skiing modalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaving aside the snow, in the mountain you can do many other adventure activities during the rest of the year such as rafting, mountain biking, kayaking, fishing, trekking, horse riding, ideal activities to do with family or friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gastronomy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gastronomy of the Lleida region can be divided between the high mountain and the plain of <strong>Lleida</strong>. In the high mountain hot and caloric dishes that originally were used to combat the cold winters stand out. The Aranese pot, the escudella, or the mountain sausages are some examples of typical dishes of the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Down to the flat, the cuisine changes, where dishes and preparations predominate that are composed of local products such as vegetables and meat from the area. The most outstanding dish of Lleida are the snails, a very special product that is difficult to find anywhere else and which is a must try. Other very delicious dishes from the Lleida region are cocas, empanadas, Agramunt nougat, and especially olive oil from the area.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the province that a priori least relate to rural tourism is Tarragona, located in the <strong>south of Catalonia</strong>, has a territory full of attractions and places of interest ideal to spend a few days and relax daily . <strong>Tarragona</strong> is a land that goes far beyond sun and beach tourism, in fact, it is full of culture, traditions, gastronomy, and history, ideal for a rural tourism stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Natural Heritage</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond sun and beach tourism, the <strong>province of Tarragona</strong> has many other attractions, in which we find an enriched natural heritage where to disconnect and be in direct contact with nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Delta de l&rsquo;Ebre</strong> is one of the largest wetlands in Europe, and has a unique, unique and incomparable framework. A landscape with a great biological richness thanks to the large quantity of flora and fauna that inhabit this area, especially migratory birds. It is a paradise for lovers of ornithology, but it is also an ideal environment for trekking or for cycling on the different paths that run through the Natural Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these lands there is also a great number of traditions and gastronomy, it is typical of the <strong>Delta del Ebro</strong> eating good rice grown in the area, on the banks of the river, or for the most daring can also try the eel from the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another natural charm we find in the <strong>province of Tarragona</strong> is the <strong>Natural Park of the Ports</strong>, located between Arag&oacute;n, Valencia and Tarragona, offering a great landscape richness away from the tourist springs and the stress that cities generate. There are a number of paths that make the <strong>Ports Park</strong> one of the best places in the province to practice hiking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This region of the province of Tarragona offers a wide variety of flora and fauna that are typical of high mountain areas, and therefore, in the <strong>south of Catalonia</strong>, they can only be found in the Ports. The mountain villages we find in the area maintain their traditions, such as craft with vegetable fibers, creating traditional everyday objects, the most important villages in the area are: <strong>Mas de Barberans</strong>, <strong>Alfara de Carles</strong>, <strong>Pa&uuml;ls</strong>, or <strong>Horta of Sant Joan</strong>, the natural place where Picasso found inspiration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gastronomy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tarragona is a Mediterranean region and therefore its gastronomy can not be other than <strong>Mediterranean</strong> <strong>cuisine</strong>. As a common denominator, gastronomy in all areas of <strong>Tarragona</strong> is based on natural products of proximity, with a great influence on the Mediterranean Sea. Recipes with a predominance of fish, vegetables and sweets create a delightful offer to accompany a rural stay in <strong>southern</strong> <strong>Catalonia</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main dishes or gastronomic traditions that we recommend are the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The cal&ccedil;ots of Valls</li>
<li>The vermouth of Reus</li>
<li>The rice of Delta de l&rsquo;Ebre</li>
<li>Prades potatoes</li>
<li>The tuna of Ametlla de Mar</li>
</ul>
